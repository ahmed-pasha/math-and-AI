# Hand Gesture Recognition and AI Integration

This project integrates hand gesture recognition with AI capabilities using various libraries such as OpenCV, cvzone, and Google's generative AI. The project captures hand gestures through a webcam, processes them, and interacts with a generative AI model to provide relevant outputs based on detected gestures.

## Introduction

This project aims to create an interactive application that recognizes hand gestures using computer vision and provides AI-generated responses. It utilizes a combination of OpenCV for video capture, cvzone for hand gesture detection, and Google's generative AI for producing responses.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and cvzone.
- AI integration to generate responses based on specific gestures.
- Drawing and erasing functionality based on hand gestures.
- Streamlit for creating a web-based user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-pasha/math-and-AI.git
cd math-and-AI
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements File
Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:

text
Copy code
opencv-python
cvzone
numpy
google-generativeai
Pillow
streamlit
Usage
Running the Application
Activate the virtual environment if not already activated:

bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
Run the Streamlit application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address (typically http://localhost:8501).

Application Functionality
Hand Gesture Detection: The application uses the webcam to detect hand gestures.
Drawing: Draw on the screen using specific hand gestures.
Erasing: Clear the canvas with a hand gesture.
AI Integration: Certain gestures trigger AI responses, which are displayed on the interface.
