# Hand Gesture Recognition and AI Integration

This project integrates hand gesture recognition with AI capabilities using various libraries such as OpenCV, cvzone, and Google's generative AI. The project captures hand gestures through a webcam, processes them, and interacts with a generative AI model to provide relevant outputs based on detected gestures.

## Introduction

This project aims to create an interactive application that recognizes hand gestures using computer vision and provides AI-generated responses. It utilizes a combination of OpenCV for video capture, cvzone for hand gesture detection, and Google's generative AI for producing responses.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and cvzone.
- AI integration to generate responses based on specific gestures.
- Drawing and erasing functionality based on hand gestures.
- Streamlit for creating a web-based user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-pasha/math-and-AI.git
cd math-and-AI



Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

streamlit run app.py
